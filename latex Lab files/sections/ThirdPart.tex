\section{Chloe Cheng}
This is the section dedicated to one of the team members, and it should be written individually . It can include a range of things; first subsection is a space for you to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the module, including complaints about the module coordinator Max Wilson. The second section should have a selfie image with Max! The last part of it is the most important one. You will need to write a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}
The module is ok, it builds on skills needed in the work place which will definitely help me in the future. However, it would be helpful if Max uploads the lecture slides before the lecture i.e. a day in advance so that I can go through the contents and try to understand so that I can build on my understanding in the lecture.

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

To include an image, you will need to remove the comments from the code below, place an image in the main folder, and do not forget to put the name of the image instead of ImgName. 

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\caption{Selfie with Max}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImgName}
%\label{fig:selfie}
%\end{figure}

You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref$. you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
In this module I have learnt about the depth and detail needed for the first stages of software engineering. It has showed me the importance of understanding exactly what the client wants in order to then produce a product that is tailored to their needs. This module has demonstrated the importance of team work and communication especially when working under pressure to allow us to work as efficiently as possible.
